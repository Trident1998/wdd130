                    During the full-scale invasion, Russia caused multibillion-dollar losses and colossal destruction to Ukraine. And although reconstruction in the conditions of war is a difficult and even adventurous task, the recovery continues. We have collected examples of houses practically destroyed by Russian shelling that were rebuilt in a year. In some places they look better than they were before.

                    This catastrophe became a symbol of the enemy's cruelty and the largest technological tragedy that inflicted immense damage on Ukraine. Despite this, the Ukrainian people <strong>refused to surrender</strong> and embarked on the path of <strong>recovery and revival</strong> after this devastating event.

                        A five-story building in the center of Kharkiv was destroyed on March 6. At that time, Russian aircraft often circled over the city.

                        One of the bombs was dropped near this house. The explosion caused the facade of several entrances to collapse. There are photos and videos of the ruins on social networks.

                        The house stood without a facade until the end of the summer. But the city council, after the survey, decided to restore the 5-story building.

                        In the reconstruction, instead of the concrete blocks from which the "Khrushchevka" was built, they decided to use foam silicate. Also, the wall was additionally insulated. The work was completed before the beginning of the heating season.

                        The residents of the building planned to restore it on their own and collected more than 1.5 million hryvnias, which they spent on the first stabilization works, but the main expenses - more than 50 million hryvnias - were taken over by the city.
