      <p>The Russian-Ukrainian war</p>

      <p>The Russians' full-scale war against Ukraine, including indiscriminate bombing of cities and genocide in the occupied territories, has already resulted in the deaths of more than 8,000 civilians. The figure provided by the UN is very approximate: it includes only confirmed losses and no data from the occupied territories. It is still unknown how many Ukrainians died in the practically destroyed Severodonetsk, Lysychansk, Popasnaya and other settlements. Mariupol is a separate story: in the city that the Russians razed to the ground last spring, according to the most conservative estimate, about 20,000 people could have died.</p>
      <p>To date, according to the UN, 8 thousand 173 Ukrainian civilians died and 13 thousand 620 were wounded during the Great War.</p>
      <p>Among the dead were 3,600 men and 2,100 women, as well as almost 500 children.</p>
      <p>This is only a small part of Russian crimes in Ukraine</p>
        
      <br>
      <p><b>Buchan tragedy.</b></p>
      <br>

      <p>The mass murder of the Ukrainian civilian population in this city of the Kyiv region, accompanied by kidnappings, torture, rape, including of children, and looting, shocked the whole world. More than 420 residents of the city died.</p>
      <p>The main method of killing was a shot in the back of the head. Particular brutality was shown in the last days of the occupation immediately before the retreat, in particular, almost all the men who remained in the occupied city, from 18 to 60 years of age, were executed.</p>
      <p>Domestic and international media wrote that after the Ukrainian Armed Forces liberated the Kyiv region, they witnessed the shocking devastation of the territory: bodies on the roads, evidence of executions of civilians, mass burials, murdered children.</p>
      <p>"Intentional killing, torture or inhuman treatment, intentional infliction of great suffering or grievous bodily harm" are considered gross violations of the Geneva Conventions of August 12, 1949 (Article 8 (2) (a) of the Rome Statute).</p>
      
      <br>
      <p><b>The killing of prisoners in Olenivka.</b></p>
      <br>

      <p>On the night of July 28-29, 2022, 53 prisoners died and more than 130 were injured in explosions on the territory of the former Volnova correctional colony â„–120, where Ukrainian defenders were held. the Russian side quickly announced that the attack was carried out by the Armed Forces of the Ukraine from the American HIMARS multiple rocket launcher system. Ukraine denied all the accusations and demanded that representatives of the UN and the International Committee of the Red Cross be admitted to the colony.
        
      <p>The General Staff of the Armed Forces reported that Russian troops deliberately fired at a correctional institution where, in particular, Ukrainian prisoners were held: "the Russian occupiers pursued their criminal goals in this way - to accuse Ukraine of committing "war crimes" and to hide the torture of prisoners and executions , which were carried out there on the orders of the occupation administration and the command of the Soviet Union in the temporarily occupied territory of the Donetsk region."</p>

      <br>
      <p><b>Detonation of the Kakhovka Hydroelectric Power Station (HES)</b></p>
      <br>

      <p>The detonation of the Kakhovka Hydroelectric Power Station (HES) became the largest man-made technological catastrophe of the 21st century. This horrifying event took place during the Russian-Ukrainian war and had serious consequences for Ukraine.</p>
      <p>As a result of the explosion, the Kakhovka HES dam was destroyed, leading to massive flooding and destruction in the areas surrounding the Dnieper River. It caused an environmental disaster and resulted in a halt in power generation.</p>
      <p>This act of terror had a profoundly negative impact on the local population, who lost their homes and the most essential source of energy. The towns and villages affected found themselves in a dire situation, deprived of electricity and energy.</p>
      <p>This catastrophe became a symbol of the enemy's cruelty and the largest technological tragedy that inflicted immense damage on Ukraine. Despite this, the Ukrainian people refused to surrender and embarked on the path of recovery and revival after this devastating event.</p>

      <h3>Rebuilding</h3>
      
      <p>During the full-scale invasion, Russia caused multibillion-dollar losses and colossal destruction to Ukraine. And although reconstruction in the conditions of war is a difficult and even adventurous task, the recovery continues. We have collected examples of houses practically destroyed by Russian shelling that were rebuilt in a year. In some places they look better than they were before.</p>
      <p>This catastrophe became a symbol of the enemy's cruelty and the largest technological tragedy that inflicted immense damage on Ukraine. Despite this, the Ukrainian people refused to surrender and embarked on the path of recovery and revival after this devastating event.</p>
      --------------
      <p>A new building on Lobanovsky Avenue in the Solomyanskyi district of Kyiv is one of the first buildings in the capital to be hit by Russian shelling.</p>
      <p>Photos and videos of the direct "arrival" of the rocket on February 26 circulated on the Internet. The explosion destroyed several apartments and spans in the entrance, the debris was scattered tens of meters around. None of the residents were injured as people left or were in storage.</p>
      <p>The residents of the building planned to restore it on their own and collected more than 1.5 million hryvnias, which they spent on the first stabilization works, but the main expenses - more than 50 million hryvnias - were taken over by the city.</p>
      --------------
      <p>A five-story building in the center of Kharkiv was destroyed on March 6. At that time, Russian aircraft often circled over the city.</p>
      <p>One of the bombs was dropped near this house. The explosion caused the facade of several entrances to collapse. There are photos and videos of the ruins on social networks.</p>
      <p>Later, when it was safe, the rescuers dismantled the debris.</p>
      <p>The house stood without a facade until the end of the summer. But the city council, after the survey, decided to restore the 5-story building.</p>
      <p>In the reconstruction, instead of the concrete blocks from which the "Khrushchevka" was built, they decided to use foam silicate. Also, the wall was additionally insulated. The work was completed before the beginning of the heating season.</p>
      --------------
      <p>In the first month of the full-scale invasion, when the Russian army stood on the approaches to Kyiv, the capital suffered from shelling. Especially the northeastern suburbs - Obolonskyi, Podilskyi and Svyatoshynskyi districts.</p>
      <p>At dawn on March 16, a Russian projectile "flew" into a nine-story building on Bogatyrska Street in Obolon. One person died, three were taken to the hospital.</p>
      <p>Several floors burned, one of the entrances collapsed. 100 out of 144 apartments were damaged. In December of last year, restoration work was completed in the building.</p>
      <p>In the comments under the photo of the restored house published on social networks, users write that the house looks better than it was before the war, although they admit that the reason for the "renovation" is tragic.</p>
      --------------
      <p>Odesa was regularly targeted by Russian shelling. One of the most famous and tragic attacks happened last Easter.</p>
      <p>The rocket hit the Tiras residential complex in Odesa itself. Seven people died, including a newborn girl with her mother and grandmother.</p>
      <p>The destruction affected the supporting structures on four floors, 30 apartments were completely destroyed, and another 62 were damaged.</p>
      <p>The local authorities decided to restore the house. The work was completed at the beginning of 2023.</p>
      --------------
      <p>At the beginning of the Russian invasion, Chernihiv took the brunt of the Russian troops. Local forces did not allow the Russians to enter Kyiv, but the city itself suffered greatly from shelling and bombing.</p>
      <p>In particular, most of the building on the street burned down from the shelling. Mazepa As of the beginning of this year, interior work is still ongoing, but the facade has actually been restored.</p>
      --------------
      <p>Before the war, the building on Chornobylska Street in the Svyatoshyn district of the capital was a typical shabby 16-story panel of the Soviet era. There are many of them here.</p>
      <p>The building burned for many hours after the Russian missile attack on the area on March 15. Four people died.</p>
      <p>Half of the apartments burned down completely, the rest were badly damaged. At the beginning, the local authorities even declared that the house could not be restored.</p>
      <p>However, later it turned out that the supporting structures were not damaged, so the house was able to be repaired. Zarazom did what the locals couldn't wait for many years, new elevators, communications, etc. At the end of last year, residents began to return here.</p>
      --------------
      <p>This house in Kharkiv's Sonyachny neighborhood burned for several days. Due to shelling, rescuers could not reach here to put out the flames.</p>
      <p>Since the beginning of the full-scale invasion, the neighborhood has been mercilessly shelled by the Russians. The high-rise building was hit several times. The latest is April 22. It caused a fire. According to local resident Raisa Zhirova, at that time the high-rise building was empty. Residents left.</p>
      <p>In September 2022, restoration work began here. Concrete could not withstand high temperatures and several days of fire. So the builders had to create anew even the retaining walls.</p>
      <p>After the restoration, it seems that not a trace of the devastating fire remained.</p>
      --------------
      <p>On March 17, a Russian rocket was shot down in the capital, its fragments fell on the 16th floor in the Darnytskyi district.</p>
      <p>It destroyed the roof, burned several upper floors. One resident died, three others were injured.</p>
      <p>The house was completely renovated at the end of last year.</p>
      --------------
      <p>This modest five-story building in Chernihiv has suffered many misfortunes. Due to shelling and fire, the roof and one of the outer walls were destroyed.</p>
      <p>In order to renovate the building, it was necessary to completely redo the roof and masonry walls, change floor slabs, internal supporting walls, not to mention windows, doors, heating and other communications.</p>
      <p>As of the end of the year, the work on the building was almost completed.</p>
      --------------
      <p>A house on Koshytsia Street in the Darnytsky district of Kyiv was damaged by Russian shelling on the second day of the war. Four people were injured.</p>
      <p>Part of the apartments in the building burned down, the windows were broken, some balconies were destroyed, and already in the fall, the repair work reached the final stage.</p>
      --------------
      <p>The towns in the suburbs of Kyiv suffered terrible destruction in the first weeks of the war, when Russian troops came close to the capital and occupied the once flourishing, neat surroundings with nice residential complexes.</p>
      <p>In particular, the Irpin residential complex "Everest 10" suffered from shelling. Debris destroyed the boiler room on the roof of the building, damaged the roof, windows, and facade. In order to save the house, it was critical to complete the renovation before the heating season.</p>
      <p>At first, the residents actively collected money for the restoration themselves, having done a significant part of the wor</p>
      <p>Subsequently, part of the funds was provided by the state, and at the last stage the Italian Terre des Hommes fund joined.</p>
      --------------
      <p>In March, Russian shells often flew over the Podilsky district in the north-west of Kyiv. During the next attack, the walls of the five-story "Khrushchevka" on Svoboda Avenue collapsed, the debris mutilated the balconies and windows.</p>
      <p>In a year, the house, which did not have the best appearance even before the shelling, is difficult to recognize. Residents started returning here last fall.</p>

      <h3>Story</h3>
      <p>The story shared by Olena Myshnyk, a resident of Borodianka, is an example of how the lives of ordinary people were turned upside down during the war. She heard about the war when she was on her way to work and the train no longer operated. She returned to her apartment, started packing an emergency bag, and began searching for a safe place for herself and her family.</p>
      <p>When Russian forces entered Borodianka, residents sought shelter in basements and looked for refuge in safe locations. Olena didn't witness the direct crimes committed by Russian soldiers, but her friend told her about the killing of a neighbor, which she herself had to bury.</p>
      <p>Olena's apartment was completely bombed, everything was destroyed. She lost everything: appliances, furniture, and personal belongings. Olena stayed in a modular settlement with her younger son while her older son joined the army.</p>
      <p>After the war, Olena Myshnyk's attitude towards Russians changed. She felt that Russians didn't hear or understand their suffering and experiences. She noted that many Russians remained brainwashed and listened to their politicians without grasping the situation from the perspective of the civilian population. She hopes that some of them might awaken and understand the true situation.</p>
      <p>The story of Olena Myshnyk is just one among many that reflect the cruelty and despair of the war in eastern Ukraine. It highlights how innocent people suffer in the conflict, losing their property and security, and emphasizes the importance of finding a path to peace and resolving the conflict.</p>
      --------------
      <p>This story tells about Maria Oleksiivna Shevchenko, a pensioner who lived in the Kharkiv region. In February, when the war between Russia and Ukraine began, the Russian military occupied her village of Liptsi. Maria Oleksiivna survived the shelling and occupation and was captured by the Russian military.</p>
      <p>During the occupation, the Russian military behaved normally for the first time and claimed that they came to liberate the residents, who, according to them, did not have the opportunity to communicate in Russian. However, later, when the Buryats and Chechens came, looting and robbery began.</p>
      <p>Maria Oleksiivna says that the Russian military fired on civilians in order to intimidate them. After the liberation of the village by Ukrainian troops, it became easier, but Maria Oleksiivna and other residents knew that the Russian military might return.</p>
      <p>At the end of her story, Maria Oleksiivna tells about her capture and after that about her capture. The Russian military detained her and, after asking questions about her grandson and expressing pro-Ukrainian positions, said: "It's your trouble that you are Ukrainians." She was kept in the basement for 10 days with other people, after which they were released.</p>
