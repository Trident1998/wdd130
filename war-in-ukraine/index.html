        <p>
            The Russians' full-scale war against Ukraine, including indiscriminate bombing of cities and genocide in the occupied territories, has already resulted in the deaths of more than 8,000 civilians. The figure provided by the UN is very approximate: it includes only confirmed losses and no data from the occupied territories. It is still unknown how many Ukrainians died in the practically destroyed Severodonetsk, Lysychansk, Popasnaya and other settlements. Mariupol is a separate story: in the city that the Russians razed to the ground last spring, according to the most conservative estimate, about 20,000 people could have died.
        </p>
        <p>
            To date, according to the UN, <strong>8 thousand 173 Ukrainian civilians died</strong>  and 13 thousand 620 were wounded during the Great War.
        </p>
        <p>
            Among the dead were 3,600 men and 2,100 women, as well as almost <strong>500 children</strong>.
        </p>

                    The mass murder of the Ukrainian civilian population in this city of the Kyiv region, accompanied by kidnappings, torture, rape, including of children, and looting, shocked the whole world. More than 420 residents of the city died.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The main method of killing was a shot in the back of the head. Particular brutality was shown in the last days of the occupation immediately before the retreat, in particular, almost all the men who remained in the occupied city, from 18 to 60 years of age, were executed.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Domestic and international media wrote that after the Ukrainian Armed Forces liberated the Kyiv region, they witnessed the shocking devastation of the territory: bodies on the roads, evidence of executions of civilians, mass burials, murdered children.
                </p>
                <p>
                    "Intentional killing, torture or inhuman treatment, intentional infliction of great suffering or grievous bodily harm" are considered gross violations of the Geneva Conventions of August 12, 1949 (Article 8 (2) (a) of the Rome Statute).

                    The detonation of the Kakhovka Hydroelectric Power Station (HES) became the largest man-made technological catastrophe of the 21st century. This horrifying event took place during the Russian-Ukrainian war and had serious consequences for Ukraine.
                </p>
                <p>
                    As a result of the explosion, the Kakhovka HES dam was destroyed, leading to massive flooding and destruction in the areas surrounding the Dnieper River. It caused an environmental disaster and resulted in a halt in power generation.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This act of terror had a profoundly negative impact on the local population, who lost their homes and the most essential source of energy. The towns and villages affected found themselves in a dire situation, deprived of electricity and energy.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This catastrophe became a symbol of the enemy's cruelty and the largest technological tragedy that inflicted immense damage on Ukraine. Despite this, the Ukrainian people refused to surrender and embarked on the path of recovery and revival after this devastating event.
