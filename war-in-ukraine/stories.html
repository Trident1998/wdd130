                <h2 class="title">"There is no wall, there are no doors, there is nothing left," a resident of Borodyanka answered how she survived the bombing</h2>

                        The story shared by Olena Myshnyk, a resident of Borodianka, is an example of how the lives of ordinary people were turned upside down during the war. She heard about the war when she was on her way to work and the train no longer operated. She returned to her apartment, started packing an emergency bag, and began searching for a safe place for herself and her family.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        When Russian forces entered Borodianka, residents sought shelter in basements and looked for refuge in safe locations. Olena didn't witness the direct crimes committed by Russian soldiers, but her friend told her about the killing of a neighbor, which she herself had to bury.

                    <p>
                        Olena's apartment was completely bombed, everything was destroyed. She lost everything: appliances, furniture, and personal belongings. Olena stayed in a modular settlement with her younger son while her older son joined the army.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        After the war, Olena Myshnyk's attitude towards Russians changed. She felt that Russians didn't hear or understand their suffering and experiences. She noted that many Russians remained brainwashed and listened to their politicians without grasping the situation from the perspective of the civilian population. She hopes that some of them might awaken and understand the true situation.

                    <p>
                        The story of Olena Myshnyk is just one among many that reflect the cruelty and despair of the war in eastern Ukraine. It highlights how innocent people suffer in the conflict, losing their property and security, and emphasizes the importance of finding a path to peace and resolving the conflict.

                <h2 class="title">"It's your trouble that you are Ukrainians": in the Kharkiv region, the Russian military captured a pensioner</h2>

                        This story tells about Maria Oleksiivna Shevchenko, a pensioner who lived in the Kharkiv region. In February, when the war between Russia and Ukraine began, the Russian military occupied her village of Liptsi. Maria Oleksiivna survived the shelling and occupation and was captured by the Russian military.

                    <p>
                       During the occupation, the Russian military behaved normally for the first time and claimed that they came to liberate the residents, who, according to them, did not have the opportunity to communicate in Russian. However, later, when the Buryats and Chechens came, looting and robbery began. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Maria Oleksiivna says that the Russian military fired on civilians in order to intimidate them. After the liberation of the village by Ukrainian troops, it became easier, but Maria Oleksiivna and other residents knew that the Russian military might return.

                    <p>
                        At the end of her story, Maria Oleksiivna tells about her capture and after that about her capture. The Russian military detained her and, after asking questions about her grandson and expressing pro-Ukrainian positions, said: "It's your trouble that you are Ukrainians." She was kept in the basement for 10 days with other people, after which they were released.

                <h2 class="title">Choreographer Oleksandr Chaika got back to work after a severe injury on the frontline</h2>
                
                <div class="text story">
                    <p>
                        Oleksandr lost his leg in the battles against the Russian invaders. He survived a complicated surgery in Ukraine, got a prosthesis in the USA, and came a long way in rehabilitation. After 10 months, Oleksandr could finally return to his favorite thing – teaching choreography and acrobatics to children.                    </p>
                    <p>
                        On February 24, 2022, with the beginning of Russia’s full-scale invasion, Oleksandr Chaika went to defend Ukraine and joined the 24th mechanized brigade of the Armed Forces of Ukraine. In the spring he got a serious mine-explosive injury with a gunshot fracture of the right femur. Doctors could not save the soldier’s leg: gangrene began, and the limb had to be completely amputated.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Despite the severe injury, Sasha (short from Oleksandr) says that he never regretted going to the front. “I believe that it is the duty of every citizen of our homeland to stand up for the defense of Ukraine. I knew that I would be useful in this way. My comrades supported me a lot, constantly joked, and thanks to them, my time in the Armed Forces became unforgettable. In addition, I’ve finally grown up. I used to fly more in my dreams, but now I look at things more consciously.”
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In the autumn, with the support of the “Future for Ukraine” charitable foundation, Oleksandr underwent prosthetics and rehabilitation at the Medical Center for Orthotics and Prosthetics (MCOP) in Washington, USA. Thanks to that, a man feels less and less pain that used to be his everyday companion for the past several months.

                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In rehabilitation, it does not matter much whether you were an athlete before, Oleksandr says. “You lie and do not move for five months, and you hardly need all those sports skills. All you feel is unbearable pain. And step by step, you go through the rehabilitation process and get to know your body anew, from the beginning”.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Currently, Oleksandr has already returned to sports and conducts group and individual acrobatics classes for children.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        When asked what he would wish for Ukrainian servicemen who lost a limb during hostilities, Sasha says: everything depends on our head.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        “Just set a goal for yourself, what to do next. I have many comrades who return to the Armed Forces even after getting a prosthesis. As for me, I will experiment and try various sports, despite numerous prohibitions from doctors. According to them, with a prosthesis like mine, it is impossible to stand on skates, ski, etc. But I can do it, and I will contribute to these sports. You can also be an example of strength for those around you and the world.”
